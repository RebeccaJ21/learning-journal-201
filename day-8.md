**Coming back**
-Coming Back after missing days, and missing even more assignments was hard.
-The concepts we learned today weren't hard it was more I didn't know how to build them into the code.
-Went back to watch the lectures from the previous days to catchup.
-Struggled working on the code, finally got some of it put together.
-Trying not to freak out about all the stuff I've already missed because it only gets me farther behind.
  -Working on current stuff is priority then I will go back and work on the other stuff.
