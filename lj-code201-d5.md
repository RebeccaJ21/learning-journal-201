#journal-201

-Coming back after missing a day so early was hard.
I had fallen behind in my day "off" and missed assignments. By the time I was feeling up to working again my momentum from the first two days was gone.
I reread the previous readings the night before this class.

-Today I spent a lot of time rewatching lectures. What we learned today made sense but when I opened my lab for today I felt very lost.

-I focused today on rewatching lectures to pick back up to where I was and to catch up on yesterdays lecture and then be able to fully understand the project in front of me.

-This weekend will be very beneficial for me to be able to catch up, sleep, and prepare for week two.
